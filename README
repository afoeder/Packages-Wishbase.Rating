# Rating system

This package provides a rating system for FLOW3. It should supply everything that is needed for that purpose,
and is inspired by the suggestions of http://schema.org/Rating.

## Entity abstract

The Rating may be implemented to your needs; use one rating class for each variant of upper/lower ratings; for example
one for rating boundaries 1-5, and one for 0-10 or such.
